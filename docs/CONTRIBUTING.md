# CONTRIBUTING

While the nominal purpose of this repository is to host tools for accessing and analyzing ACQ files for MCIRCC members, its secondary function is to provide a space to learn and teach git techniques. This techniques include making and tracking issues, writing documentation, branching, forking, and submitting pull requests. Please feel free to use it as tool to learn and try new things – you cannot mess anything up beyond repair.

In this spirit, I encourage contributors to follow a more "formal" pull request process when adding to the repository, despite its relatively small stature and scope. This includes making all changes via pull request.

## Making a pull request

### 1. Create an issue  
1. Create the issue via the [Issues](https://github.com/bccummings/acq-tools/issues) tab.
2. Create a descriptive title, and any comments you need to describe the issue.
3. If applicable, assign a corresponding label. These include the `bug` label, to be used if something breaks unexpectedly. If it's something minor that isn't impacting your work, use the `minor-bug` label. Similarly, `feature-request` and `question` flags may be used for desired new features, or just to ask a question respectively. More labels may be added in the future - they all have a short description, so pick the one that feels right.
4. If applicable, assign the issue to the "Issue Tracker" Project. This helps the team visualize the status of contributions via the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/bccummings/acq-tools/projects/1) kanban board.

### 2. Make a branch or fork
1. Depending on your access level, either branch or fork the repository.  
2. Make the requisite changes.  
3. **IMPORTANT**: When committing your changes, add the issue number somewhere in the commit message (e.g. for Issue 3, the commit message should be something like `#3 Add steps to CONTRIBUTING.md`. The `#3` symbol automagically associates the commit with the issue.  
4. Test your code to make sure everything works as intended.

### 3. Make a pull request
1. Test your code again (and again!).
2. Make a pull request.
3. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed. This process may change.
